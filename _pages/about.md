As a data scientist and researcher with deep roots in people analytics, I’ve spent the past decade asking one essential question: How can we use data to truly understand and support the people who power our organizations?

From developing attrition models and future-skill forecasting tools at the Royal Bank of Canada to co-designing inclusive workforce products at Microsoft, my career has centered around applying machine learning, NLP, and social computing to human challenges. I’ve led research projects with industry, mentored teams of data scientists, and published in top-tier HCI and CSCW venues. My academic journey—including a PhD in Computer Engineering—equipped me to approach talent questions with both technical precision and social awareness.

Now, I'm looking to take the next step: leading people analytics or data science teams in shaping the future of work. I thrive at the intersection of data, policy, and empathy—and I’m driven to create systems where organizations and employees can grow together.
