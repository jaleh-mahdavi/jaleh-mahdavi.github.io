  abstract={The global COVID-19 pandemic has spurred on new collaborations across borders, and emphasized the importance of supporting wellbeing in the workplace, whether that workplace is hybrid, remote, or in-person. Work in CSCW, HCI, and organizational psychology has explored how people come to understand their wellbeing at work, and the role of identity, culture, and organizational factors in that process. In this study, we build on this past research and explore the importance of these factors when designing tools that support worker wellbeing for location-independent teams. We ask the question: how did organizational, cultural, and individual factors influence how workers understood their workplace wellbeing needs during the move to remote work? To investigate this question, we conduct a large scale linguistic analysis of 13,265 diary entries collected between 2020 - 2022, and complement it with in-depth interviews with 26 global employees, exploring intersections between technology, context, and wellbeing needs. We utilize this data to analyze the broader human infrastructure supporting hybrid and remote work, demonstrating how ideas around wellbeing are influenced by the (often technology-mediated) environment around both information and essential workers, and power differentials within it. Building on our findings, we provide recommendations for how technology design can better support more diverse and inclusive forms of worker wellbeing.},

  author={Mirlohi, Amin and Mahdavimoghaddam, Jalehsadat and Jovanovic, Jelena and Al-Obeidat, Feras N and Khani, Mehdi and Ghorbani, Ali A and Bagheri, Ebrahim},
  abstract= {Researchers have already observed social contagion effects in both in-person and online interactions. However, such studies have primarily focused on users’ beliefs, mental states, and interests. In this article, we expand the state of the art by exploring the impact of social contagion on social alignment, i.e., whether the decision to socially align oneself with the general opinion of the users on the social network is contagious to one’s connections on the network or not. The novelty of our work in this article includes: 1) unlike earlier work, this article is among the first to explore the contagiousness of the concept of social alignment on social networks; 2) our work adopts an instrumental variable approach to determine reliable causal relations between observed social contagion effects on the social network; and 3) our work expands beyond the mere presence of contagion in social alignment and also explores the role of population heterogeneity on social alignment contagion. Based on the systematic collection and analysis of data from two large social network platforms, namely, Twitter and Foursquare, we find that a user’s decision to socially align or distance from social topics and sentiments influences the social alignment decisions of their connections on the social network. We further find that such social alignment decisions are significantly impacted by population heterogeneity.},

  title={Exploring the utility of social content for understanding future in-demand skills},
  author={Mahdavimoghaddam, Jalehsadat and Bahuguna, Ayush and Bagheri, Ebrahim},
  abstract={Rapid technological innovations, especially in the information technology space, demand the workforce to be vigilant by acquiring new skills to remain relevant and employable. The workforce needs to be engaged in a continuous lifelong learning process by educating themselves about skills that will be in demand in the future. To do so, it is essential for students, job seekers, and even recruiters to know which skills will be in demand in the future and to invest time and resources in developing these skills. On this basis, the main objective of this paper is to investigate whether social content can offer insight into potential future in-demand skills in the IT job market. Based on the analysis of social content from Reddit and job posting data from Dice and Monster websites, we find that social content related to job skills is a strong indicator for future in-demand skills. We further find that specific social content associated with recruitment-related topics are stronger indicators of future skills. Our findings encourage learners and job seekers to pay close attention to online social content to strategically plan new skills and maximize their employability.},

  title={The Utility of Social Media in Understanding the Future of Work},
  author={Mahdavimoghaddam, Jalehsadat},
  abstract= {There is a growing body of research that leverages online social networks to study users’ interests and behaviors for reasons such as personalization and recommendation. However, the utility of online social platforms in understanding and predicting the labor market has not received the attention that it deserves in the literature. Therefore, this Ph.D. research will explore the temporal and causal relationships between online social topics and the changes in the job market from several complementary aspects. More specifically, this research will be focused on addressing three main problems: (1) investigating whether social content is an effective indicator of future job requirements; (2) analyzing if any meaningful causal relationship could be found between work-related emotions expressed on online social platforms and their social demographics; and, (3) identifying potential causal impacts of community support on the online users’ well-being in the future job market. The findings of my doctoral dissertation will assist learners and job seekers to gain insight into important job-related skill trends, which can help them in their career-long learning process to stay in demand and remain employable. Also, the outcomes of this thesis can help governments and policymakers understand workforce challenges and design programs and solutions that can support workers in the knowledge economy and enhance their well-being.},

  title={On the congruence between online social content and future it skill demand},
  author={Mahdavimoghaddam, Jalehsadat and Krishnaswamy, Niranjan and Bagheri, Ebrahim},
  abstract= {The speed of digital transformation has resulted in new challenges for job seekers to become lifelong learners and to develop new skills faster than before. In this paper, our main objective is to examine how online content can serve as indicators for changes to the Information Technology (IT) industry and its in-demand skills. To study this relationship, we collect Reddit posts to represent social media content and job postings to reflect the IT industry based on which we explore possible correlations between them. Further, we propose a methodology to quantitatively estimate the predictive power of social media content for future in-demand skills. Our results show that the frequency of skill-related conversations on Reddit correlates with the popularity of skills in job posting data. Additionally, our findings indicate that the number of social posts dedicated to a specific skill can be a strong indicator for future job requirements. This is an important finding because identifying what skills the labor force should acquire will assist job seekers to plan their lifelong learning objectives to (a) maximize their employability, (b) continuously update their skills to remain in demand, and (c) be informed and actively engaged in defining knowledge trends, rather than reactively becoming informed of the latest information.},

  title={Inferring political preferences of active content consumers in Twitter},
  author={Mahdavimoghaddam, Jalehsadat},
  abstract= {The growth of user engagement in online social networks has generated a tremendous amount of content regarding various topics. This rich content helps businesses to infer interesting information about public opinions and preferences of OSN users to serve their customers with customized services. Also, this inferred information can be used for different prediction purposes, such as predicting the possible outcome of an election. Despite the huge increase in the amount of produced content in OSNs, many users tend to consume content on certain topics rather than provide content themselves. Therefore, it is a challenge to discover preferences of content consumers who are silent on a given topic. In this thesis, a novel approach is proposed that predicts personal preferences of content consumers through what they read rather than what they write. In other words, in this study it is shown that only relying on followees to predict preferences of content consumers leads to promising results.},
